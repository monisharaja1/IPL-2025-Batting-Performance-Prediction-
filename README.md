# IPL 2025 Batting Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the **batting performance of IPL players in the 2025 season** using machine learning techniques. By analyzing past player statistics and performance indicators, the model helps forecast batting outcomes, which can be useful for teams, analysts, and fantasy league enthusiasts.

## 📂 Dataset

* **File:** `IPL2025Batters.csv`
* **Description:** Contains batting statistics of IPL players, including:

  * Matches Played
  * Runs Scored
  * Batting Average
  * Strike Rate
  * Number of 50s/100s
  * Boundaries (4s & 6s)
  * Player Role & Experience

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values
   * Feature engineering (e.g., strike rate calculation, consistency index)
   * Encoding categorical variables

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Player-wise performance visualization
   * Correlation between batting stats and overall performance
   * Distribution plots for runs, averages, and strike rates

3. **Model Building**

   * Machine Learning models applied for prediction:

     * Linear Regression
     * Random Forest Regressor
     * Gradient Boosting
     * Decision Tree Regressor
   * Model evaluation using R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

4. **Prediction**

   * Predicts batting performance (e.g., runs scored in IPL 2025)
   * Compares model accuracy and selects best-performing model

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas, NumPy** → Data preprocessing
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** → Machine learning models

## 🚀 Results

* Built regression models to predict player batting performance
* Identified key batting statistics influencing player success
* Achieved reliable predictions using ensemble learning methods

## 📈 Use Cases

* Teams can use predictions to plan batting order and strategies
* Fantasy league players can make informed player selections
* Analysts can forecast player performance for IPL 2025
